This special data package contains 19037 protein-ligand complexes, 143 nucleic
acid complexes, 2798 protein-protein complexes, and 1032 protein-nucleic acid 
complexes in PDBbind v2020 that also remain in PDBbind v2024. 

Importantly, the structure files of each complex in this data package are from 
PDBbind v2024, i.e. they are re-processed with the refined workflow that is 
mentioned on our PDBbind+ web site. In general, these re-processed structure 
files are in a better quality as compared to those included in PDBbind v2020.    
Besides, information associated with a certain number of complexes, such as 
binding data, have been updated in the index files as well. 

This data package is free to access for registered users of the PDBbind+ web 
site. It thus gives the users a chance to test the newly processed complex
structures in the PDBbind data package before purchasing any newer version of 
PDBbind. Application of this new data set, although it does not go beyond v.2020, 
to tasks like model training may yield improved outcomes.
